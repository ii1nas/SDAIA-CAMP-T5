The dataset contains aspects of customer behavior and demographic information, with the targeted outcome specified in the `Exited` column. Your goal is to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can effectively predict this outcome. The model should be trained using the provided data, with a strong focus on tuning and optimizing to achieve high accuracy. The performance of your ANN will be critically evaluated based on its predictive accuracy and the precision of its classifications."],"metadata":{"id":"bjo55u_BmUiN"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1COFHkpRmSTN"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 1: Data Exploration\n","- Load the dataset provided and display the first few rows to understand the structure and the type of data.\n","- Check for missing values and outliers."],"metadata":{"id":"3KTbIzPLma_8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"q2ptYwUumcPf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 2: Data Preprocessing\n","- Perform any necessary preprocessing steps including normalization, encoding, and splitting the data into training and test sets."],"metadata":{"id":"Gb37if7PmeDP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"d81xot6BmfO5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 3: Visualization (optional)\n","- Visualize the relationships between features using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices."],"metadata":{"id":"A6KEJRypo_DL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Am04Y7uRpE5i"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 4: Model Design\n","- Define an ANN model.\n","- Use appropriate activation functions for the hidden layers and the output layer."],"metadata":{"id":"_MNx1HYkmt6A"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"hZs7z6KOmv1v"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 5: Model Compilation\n","- Choose a suitable optimizer.
